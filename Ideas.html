<p>This pages is for all sorts of ideas and musings that started in #mumble, mostly on improving usability.&lt;br /&gt;<br />
The intention of improvements on this page are to increase the potential user base and decrease the barrier to entry for Mumble.&lt;br /&gt;<br />
If an average, non-technical user asks "why does this X," or gets frustrated with something, it should end up here.</p>


<h2>UI Rework</h2>
<p>Some of these areas touch on improving the UI.<br />
pcgod and myself (crazedfred) have noted some Microsoft User Interface guidelines  that may be relevant: [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms997506.aspx one] [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511258.aspx two]</p>

<p>The Inductive User Interface has these guidelines:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Focus each page on a single task</li>
	<li>State the task</li>
	<li>Make the page's contents suit the task</li>
	<li>Offer links to secondary tasks</li>
</ul>
<p>The Windows User Experience Design Principles are a bit more specific:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Nail the basics</li>
	<li>Design experiences, not features</li>
	<li>Be great at something</li>
	<li>Don't be all things to all people</li>
	<li>Make the hard decisions</li>
	<li>Make the experience like a friendly conversation</li>
	<li>Do the right thing by default</li>
	<li>Make it just work</li>
	<li>Ask questions carefully</li>
	<li>Make it a pleasure to use</li>
	<li>Make it a pleasure to see</li>
	<li>Make it responsive</li>
	<li>Keep it simple</li>
	<li>Avoid bad experiences</li>
	<li>Design for common problems</li>
	<li>Don't be annoying</li>
	<li>Reduce effort, knowledge, and thought</li>
	<li>Follow the guidelines</li>
	<li>Test your UI</li>
</ul>
<h3>Audio wizard</h3>

<p>I feel like an overwhelming majority of users will click "next" through the wizard until they're "allowed" to connect to something.&lt;br /&gt;<br />
A large portion of personal experience with VoIP setups are typically in-game; eg, a new user needs to connect to VoIP as fast as possible.&lt;br /&gt;<br />
This person is not interested in complicated configurations, typically has people wait on them, and wants it to get working ASAP.</p>
