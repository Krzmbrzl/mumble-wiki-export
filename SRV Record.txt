The SRV (''Service Record'') is a resource record used in DNS, allowing the specification of host and port locations for services on a domain.

SRV Record support was added in '''Mumble 1.3.0'''.  

SRV Records are evaluated before ''A'', ''AAAA'', or ''CNAME'' records.

=== Purpose ===
SRV  Records are useful because they allow easy and clear multi-host configurations from the client point of view.
<br>
From the perspective of a server host, you no longer need to worry about a mumble-specific subdomain, or providing port configuration details (if they are non-default) to prospective clients â€“ all of that information is gleaned from the SRV record.

== SRV Record ==
=== SRV Specification ===
SRV Records are formatted as such:

 _service._proto.name TTL class SRV priority weight port target

* '''service''': the symbolic name of the desired service.
* '''proto''': the transport protocol of the desired service; this is usually either TCP or UDP.
* '''name''': the domain name for which this record is valid.
* '''TTL''': standard DNS time to live field.
* '''class''': standard DNS class field.
* '''priority''': the priority of the target host, lower value means more preferred.
* '''weight''': A relative weight for records with the same priority.
* '''port''': the TCP or UDP port on which the service is to be found.
* '''target''': the canonical hostname of the machine providing the service.


=== Mumble Records ===
Mumble uses the following values:
* '''service''': mumble
* '''proto''': tcp


=== Examples ===
A typical SRV record for mumble might look like this:
 <span style="color:gray;">''# _service._proto.name.  TTL  CLASS  SRV  PRIORITY  WEIGHT  PORT  TARGET''</span>
  _mumble._tcp.example.com. 86400 IN SRV 0 5 64738 mumble.example.com.

==== Subdomains ====
You can also supplement an existing subdomain hosted service by adding an SRV record for it.
<br>
This will allow you to use arbitrary ports easier, or change/move the subdomain ''A'', ''AAAA'', or ''CNAME'' record without requiring clients to reconfigure.

Subdomains might be configured like this:
 <span style="color:gray;">''# _service._proto.name.  TTL  CLASS  SRV  PRIORITY  WEIGHT  PORT  TARGET''</span>
  _mumble._tcp.mumble.example.com. 86400 IN SRV 0 5 64738 mumble.example.com.
  _mumble._tcp.mumble.example.com. 86400 IN SRV 0 5 3050 murmur2.example.net.

== SSL Certificates and SRV ==
Mumble will connect using the domain specified in the '''name''' value, so if having a signed and valid SSL Certificate is important, make sure it is issued for the '''name''' domain.

== Further Reading ==
SRV Records can be used for fail-over, and load balancing, but these are more complicated concepts (and some are hard to apply to Mumble), so they are not explored here.
