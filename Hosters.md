'''Commercial''' designates whether a provider charges for the service or not.

'''CVP''' indicates that a provider supports the [[Channel Viewer Protocol]], which allows easy setup of a web based tree view of your server on your site.

'''RPC''' indicates that a provider allows access to control the server in some fashion. Shell-style hosts may allow you to configure an Ice endpoint for your own use, while virtual-hosted providers may simply provide a wrapper layer over it using REST, XML, or Telnet.
