<h1>Download and Install Mumble and Mumble-Server (aka Murmur)</h1>

<h2>Windows</h2>
<p>'''Mumble:'''&lt;br&gt;   <br />
Download the latest stable version of Mumble from the [https://www.mumble.info/downloads/ Official Website].&lt;br&gt;   <br />
The installer will guide you through the installation and configuration of Mumble.    </p>

<p>Alternatively you can download and run the latest MSI installer (mumble-1.x.x.msi; "winx64" for the 64-bit version) from the [https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/releases GitHub releases page].&lt;br&gt;    <br />
''Note:'' Releases that include the term "RC" are '''R'''elease''' C'''andidates and therefore Test Versions.</p>

<p>'''Mumble-Server (aka Murmur):'''&lt;br&gt;   <br />
The Mumble-Installer includes an option to install the Mumble-Server.</p>

<h2>Mac OS X</h2>
<p>'''Mumble:'''&lt;br&gt; <br />
Download the latest stable version of Mumble from the [https://www.mumble.info/downloads/ Official Website].&lt;br&gt;</p>

<p>Alternatively you can download the latest version from the: [https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/releases GitHub releases page]. &lt;br&gt;    <br />
''Note:'' Releases that include the term "RC" are '''R'''elease''' C'''andidates and therefore Test Versions.</p>

<p>In order to be able to use the '''<a href="Overlay">Overlay</a>''' it has to be installed separately. &lt;br&gt;<br />
To install it: launch Mumble, go into ''Mumble's settings'' -&gt; Overlay section and you should see an ''option to install it''.&lt;br&gt;<br />
The reason for the separate installation is that Mumble itself does not need administrative rights to install, but the overlay does.</p>

<p>'''Mumble-Server (aka Murmur):'''&lt;br&gt; <br />
You can download a static version of the Mumble-Server from the [https://www.mumble.info/downloads/ Official Website].&lt;br&gt;</p>
