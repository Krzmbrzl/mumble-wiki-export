Version 1.2.12 is a maintenance release in the stable 1.2-series of
Mumble and the successor of Mumble [1.2.11](1.2.11 "wikilink").

Issues fixes in this release include:

  - In Mumble 1.2.11, the log would always scroll-to-bottom, even if
    manually scrolled up to view a previous message. Scroll-to-bottom is
    now only triggered if the log view has not manually scrolled by the
    user.
  - Fixed a bug where a stale overlay client could cause the Mumble UI
    to freeze under some circumstances.
  - Fixed a bug where CELT and Opus encoders were not properly reset
    when using more than one frame per packet in Mumble. This would
    previously cause noisy artifacts at the beginning of transmissions.
