Developing is one way to [contribute](Contributing "wikilink") to the
Mumble project.

You can help us review and clean/refactor our code, implement new
features or update outdated ones (like our pos-audio plugins). You can
then submit the patches to us and we will gladly review them and
probably accept them. :)
