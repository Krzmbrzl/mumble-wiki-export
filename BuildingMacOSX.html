<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This guide describes the method to get a fully working and redistributable version of Mumble and Murmur that uses the Cocoa version of Qt 4.</p>

<p>To build Mumble you will need:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Mac OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion)</li>
	<li>Xcode 4.4</li>
</ul>
<h3>Creating a build environment</h3>

<p>The git repository at <a href="https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble-releng">https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble-releng</a> contains pre-made scripts that build the current canonical Mumble OS X build environment.</p>

<p>Simply clone the repo, and cd into it:</p>

<p>  $ git clone <a href="https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble-releng">https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble-releng</a><br />
  $ cd mumble-releng/buildenv/1.3.x/osx</p>

<p>Create a MumbleBuild directory in your home dir:</p>

<p>  $ mkdir -p /MumbleBuild</p>

<p>Copy the 'env' script to the directory you created in the previous step:</p>

<p>  $ cp env /MumbleBuild/env</p>

<p>Source the env script to set up the proper environment variables for the Mumble build environment:</p>

<p>  $ source /MumbleBuild/env</p>

<p>Build the enviroment:</p>

<p>  $ ./build-all.bash</p>

<p>Once this is done, you should have a fully functional installation of Mumble's dependencies (tools and libs) in a self-contained MumbleBuild directory in your home directory.</p>

<h3>Building Mumble</h3>

<p>Make sure you've sourced /MumbleBuild/env into your current shell session:</p>

<p> $ source /MumbleBuild/env</p>

<p>Fetch the Mumble source from Git into a directory of your choosing:</p>

<p> git clone --recursive <a href="https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble">https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble</a></p>

<p>To build the client, execute:</p>

<p> cd mumble<br />
 qmake -recursive -Wall main.pro CONFIG+="release static"<br />
 make</p>

<p>If everything went well, you should now have a Mumble.app application bundle in the release directory of the root of the source tree.</p>

<h3>Building Murmur</h3>

<p>Make sure you've sourced /MumbleBuild/env into your current shell session:</p>

<p> $ source /MumbleBuild/env</p>

<p>Fetch the Mumble and Murmur source from Git into a directory of your choosing:</p>

<p> git clone --recursive <a href="https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble">https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble</a></p>

<p>To build the server, execute:</p>

<p> cd mumble<br />
 qmake -spec unsupported/macx-clang -recursive CONFIG+="release static no-client no-dbus"<br />
 make</p>

<p>If everything went well, you should now have a murmur binary in the release directory of the root of the source tree.</p>

<h3>Distributing Mumble</h3>

<p>If you wish to create a proper redistributable Mumble application bundle, please refer to the osxdist.py script in<br />
the macx/scripts directory. This will help you clean up your application bundle, include the needed dependencies, resources etc., and create a compressed disk image - ready to redistribute!</p>

<p>The script expects you to be in the root of the source tree. After executing, it will spit out a .dmg of your Mumble build in the release folder.</p>

<p>If you only have a Mumble.app, and have not built Murmur, you should also pass the</p>

<p> --no-server</p>

<p>parameter to the osxdist.py script. This will not attempt to package Murmur-specific files in the generated .dmg.</p>

<p>The script supports code signing, and among other things, allow you to build a copy of Mumble signed with your Developer ID certificates from Apple.<br />
To build with code signing enabled, use the following three parameters to the osxdist.py script:</p>

<ul>
	<li>--developer-id='&lt;Name or Organization&gt;'</li>
	<li>--keychain=&lt;keychain&gt; (optional, defaults to 'login.keychain')</li>
</ul>
