The following guide describes how to obtain a free StartCom Class 1
S/MIME certificate using Firefox 3.5. StartCom unfortunately does not
support Internet Explorer 8 at this time. As of 2014 Chrome has been
tested and works just fine with StartCom. All images are click-able, if
more information is needed.

1.  Go to <https://www.startssl.com> and click the top right button.
      - ![Mumble_StartCom_ff_1_small.jpg](Mumble_StartCom_ff_1_small.jpg
        "Mumble_StartCom_ff_1_small.jpg")
2.  Click the sign-up button.
      - ![Mumble_StartCom_ff_2_small.jpg](Mumble_StartCom_ff_2_small.jpg
        "Mumble_StartCom_ff_2_small.jpg")
3.  Fill in your details. Press continue. Now there could be a slight
    wait while they manually check your details. You really need to
    provide your actual address and phone number in order for this part
    of the process to go smooth. StartCom review the applications
    manually, but rather quickly under normal circumstances. If all goes
    well you should get a confirmation code to the email address you
    entered.

5.  Wait for an activation link to arrive in your mailbox, and click the
    link in the mail and enter the code that's provided in this new
    mail.
      - The mail should look something like this:
