Mumble is using a protocol called Bonjour to announce and detect servers in local networks. If you enabled Bonjour for your LAN server it will appear in the public server list of other Mumble users in this network.

If you want to know more about Bonjour you can find additional information on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonjour_(software) Wikipedia] or directly at [http://developer.apple.com/bonjour/ Apple].
