Mumble Reader is a JQuery/Javascript tool which can read [[Channel Viewer Protocol]]. It can also generate CVP using [http://www.zeroc.com/icephp.html ZeroC IcePHP] version 3.3. Currently Mumble Reader's back-end querying tool will not work with the latest version of ZeroC IcePHP (version 3.4), although you can use another CVP provider such as [[Mumble PHP Interface]] which does support IcePHP version 3.4. 

Mumble Reader is hosted on [https://github.com/Pimmetje/mumblereader Github]

Edit: Updated the link to github as google code is not working anymore. It should work in 3.4 last time i tried a few years ago. Comments or pull requests are welcome on github.
