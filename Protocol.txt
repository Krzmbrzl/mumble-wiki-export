The Mumble Protocol is Open Source, just like Mumble itself. The source code for the current version can be found in the Git repository in the file [https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/blob/master/src/Mumble.proto Mumble.proto].

= Protocol documentation =

A complete documentation about the protocol can be found at 
[https://mumble-protocol.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ readthedocs.org].

= UDP Ping packet =

Mumble supports querying the following data by sending a ping packet to the target server. Both the request and the response packets are formatted in Big Endian.

The ping request packet contains the following data:

{|
!Width
!Data type
!Value
!Comment
|-
|4 bytes
|int
|0
|Denotes the request type
|-
|8 bytes
|long long
|ident
|Used to identify the reponse.
|}


The response will then contain the following data:

{|
!Width
!Data type
!Value
!Comment
|-
|4 bytes
|int
|Version
|e.g., \x0\x1\x2\x3 for 1.2.3. Can be interpreted as one single int or four signed chars.
|-
|8 bytes
|long long
|ident
|the ident value sent with the request
|-
|4 bytes
|int
|Currently connected users count
|
|-
|4 bytes
|int
|Maximum users (slot count)
|
|-
|4 bytes
|int
|Allowed bandwidth
|}

Example implementations of pinging:

* The official python script [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mumble-voip/mumble-scripts/master/Non-RPC/mumble-ping.py mumble-ping.py]
* The IRC bot [[K-10]]â€™s [https://bitbucket.org/Svedrin/k10-plugins/src/tip/BwCalc/plugin.py#cl-120 extension of that script] that adds IPv6 support
* The C#/.NET Core [https://github.com/Kissaki/mumble-ping mumble-ping application]
* [https://git.lolcat.ca/lolcat/mumble-ping PHP implementation]
