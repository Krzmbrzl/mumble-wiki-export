<p>Mumble 1.2.13 fixes a security-relevant bug in Murmur when running on Windows systems that allowed an unauthenticated user to cause Denial of Service on the serverâ€™s UDP connection.</p>

<p>We would like to thank [https://github.com/LuaMilkshake LuaMilkshake] for responsibly reporting this issue to the Mumble project.</p>

<p>This release of Mumble on Windows is also the first stable release in the 1.2-series that is only code-signed with a SHA256 authenticode signature and certificate. Previous releases were signed by both a SHA1 signature and certificate, as well as a SHA256 signature and certificate.</p>

<p>This new code-signing setup can cause issues with some versions of Windows that do not support SHA256 code-signing. If your Mumble installer on Windows does not seem to be Authenticode signed, it probably means that your version of Windows does not support SHA256 code-signing. In that case, we recommend that you ensure the integrity of your Mumble installer by verifying the detached GPG signature (mumble-1.2.13.msi.sig) against our [https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble-gpg-signatures/blob/master/gpg.txt "Mumble Automatic Build Infrastructure 2016"] GPG key.</p>

<p>Issues fixed in this release include:</p>

<p>In previous versions of Mumble, it was possible to perform a Denial of Service attack on Murmur servers running on Windows. See [https://www.mumble.info/security/Mumble-SA-2016-001.txt Mumble-SA-2016-001] ([https://www.mumble.info/security/Mumble-SA-2016-001.sig sig]) for more information.</p>

<p>For a full changelog, please see the [https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/compare/1.2.12...1.2.13 diff between 1.2.12 and 1.2.13] on GitHub.</p>

<p>We recommend that all users of Murmur (the server component of Mumble) on Windows upgrade immediately.</p>
