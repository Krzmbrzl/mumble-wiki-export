Mumble Reader is a JQuery/Javascript tool which can read [Channel Viewer
Protocol](Channel_Viewer_Protocol "wikilink"). It can also generate CVP
using [ZeroC IcePHP](http://www.zeroc.com/icephp.html) version 3.3.
Currently Mumble Reader's back-end querying tool will not work with the
latest version of ZeroC IcePHP (version 3.4), although you can use
another CVP provider such as [Mumble PHP
Interface](Mumble_PHP_Interface "wikilink") which does support IcePHP
version 3.4.

[Github](https://github.com/Pimmetje/mumblereader)

Edit: Updated the link to github as google code is not working anymore.
It should work in 3.4 last time i tried a few years ago. Comments or
pull requests are welcome on github.
