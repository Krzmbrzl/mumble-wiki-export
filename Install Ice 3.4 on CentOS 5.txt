Ice 3.4 is now in Beta with quite a bit of changes in the PHP api. Here is a guide howto install Ice with PHP bindings on a CentOS 5 machine and getting the weblist.php example distributed with murmur to work.

 cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
 wget http://www.zeroc.com/download/Ice/3.4/rhel5/zeroc-ice.repo

Edit the zeroc-ice.repo to look like this:

 [zeroc-ice]
 name=Ice 3.4b for RHEL $releasever - $basearch
 baseurl=http://www.zeroc.com/download/Ice/3.4/rhel5/$basearch
 enabled=0
 gpgcheck=1
 gpgkey=http://www.zeroc.com/download/RPM-GPG-KEY-zeroc-beta

This way the repo is not enabled by default. My flavor of CentOS didn't have $releasever set so I changed the baseurl to a static version 5.

 yum --enable zeroc-ice install ice-php ice-php-devel
 /etc/init.d/httpd graceful

Now go the murmur folder and locate Murmur.ice

 slice2php Murmur.ice

Edit weblist.php:

remove

 Ice_loadProfile();

replace with
 
 require 'Ice.php';
 require 'Murmur.php';
 $ICE = Ice_initialize();

Move weblist.php and Murmur.php to your web space and access weblist.php

As of now the PHP implementation does '''not''' implement the Implicit Context, so you can't use murmur with a secret. When ZeroC decides to implement it you should be able to do something like this:

 $ICE->getImplicitContext('secret', 'passphrase');

== Getting Glacier to work ==
Glacier2 is a Ice '''routing and firewall utility''', and allows you to securely run the server on one machine and murmur on another. Note that if both server and client are on a secure LAN, you can just use iptables to protect the Ice port, which is a lot easier than setting up Glacier2. Also, '''since Mumble 1.2.2 you can set an icesecret''' in your murmur.ini and use it as a password. '''This is a lot easier to set up''' and use than Glacier2.

 yum  install ice-servers

You will need an extra require:

 require 'Glacier2.php';

Then just follow the guide [[Ice#Using_Glacier2]].
