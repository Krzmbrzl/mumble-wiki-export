<h2>Installation of Mumble on not natively supported OS</h2>

<h3>Client</h3>
<h4>Installation of the Mumble client on Windows 2000</h4>

<p>The Mumble-Client is only supported to be run on Windows XP or higher (VISTA/Win7 etc.). However it seems that following these steps most basic functions should work. </p>


<p>Here's a quick guide to get the mumble client running.</p>

<p>The fix is confirmed to be working for mumble 1.2.x <br />
Please read the Wrapper guide carefully and follow the fix step by step if you are having problems getting the client to work.</p>

<ul>
	<li>MISSING DLL EXPORTS</li>
	<li>KERNEL32.dll - GetVolumePathNamesForVolumeNameW</li>
	<li>ws_32.dll - getaddrinfo</li>
	<li>wtsapi32.dll - WTSRegisterSessionNotification</li>
	<li>psapi.dll - GetProcessImageFileNameW</li>
	<li>dbghelp.dll - MiniDumpWriteDump</li>
</ul>
<p>How to fix it:<br />
Get the KERNEL32.dll, ws_32.dll and wtsapi32.dll from the wrapper pack . Make sure you follow the instructions as the readme of the wrapper pack says.</p>

<p>Quick guide:</p>
<ul>
	<li>1) Copy original corresponding dlls from WINNT\system32 in mumble-client main folder</li>
	<li>2) Rename them to kernel32_ORG.dll/wtsapi32_ORG.dll/ws_32_ORG.dll</li>
	<li>3) Place kernel32.dll/wtsapi32.dll/ws_32.dll from the wrapper zip file in the same folder</li>
	<li>4) Run ExcludeFromKnownDlls.reg if it's your first time using the wrapper.</li>
	<li>5) Get Dbghelp.dll, unzip and put it in the same folder.</li>
	<li>6) Get psapi.dll and put it in the same folder.</li>
	<li>7) Run the mumble Client !</li>
</ul>
<p>WARNING: It's still strongly recommended to read the wrapper readme first and to backup your original before you start toying with your dlls.</p>

<h3>Server</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Nothing here right now. &lt;- please (someone) document on whether it works or not …</li>
</ul>
<h2>Run Multiple instances of the Mumble Client</h2>

<p>if you start the mumble client with the option '''''-m'''''<br />
You are allowed to start an other instance of the client on the same System.<br />
Be aware that this switch is unsupported and can cause all kinds of strange behaviours as the two clients still share the same config, database, overlay,.....you get the idea ;-) (especially make sure you don't use volume attenuation^^)</p>

<h2>Run Mumble Client without an active certificate</h2>
<p>You can start Mumble with the '''-n''' command-line parameter to make it ignore the current user certificate. This way you can temporarily “disable” it for your Mumble process. In combination with the ''-m'' parameter for multiple instances you can connect twice to the same server, even though you’re registered with a certificate!</p>
