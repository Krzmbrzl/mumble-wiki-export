This Wiki page lists the known iOS 7 compatibility issues with the current release of Mumble for iOS, version 1.2.1.

= No audio being recorded =

On some devices (such as iPhone 4S) running Mumble for iOS 1.2.1 on iOS 7 can cause the app to not be able to record.

Note however, that not all devices are affected of this issue. For example, a 3rd generation iPad works just fine.

If you experience this issue, you can work around it by disabling Echo Cancellation in the Preferences:

* On the main screen, tap on the 'Preferences' button.
* In Preferences, tap "Advanced".
* In the Advanced Audio preferences, set 'Echo Cancellation' to off.

This should fix the issue -- however, an updated version of Mumble for iOS will soon be available that fixes this in general.

If you do not wish to disable Echo Cancellation, you can also work around the issue by entering and exiting the app's Preferences. (This causes a restart of the app's audio engine.)
