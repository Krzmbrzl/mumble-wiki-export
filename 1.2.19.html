<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The Mumble team has released version [https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/releases/tag/1.2.19 1.2.19] of the Mumble VoIP application. Version 1.2.19 is a bugfix and security release in the stable 1.2-series of Mumble.</p>

<p>This version of Mumble fixes a problem where the output of Murmur’s -limits command was never shown. It also updates the OpenSSL version that our binary packages are built against to 1.0.2k.</p>

<h3>Changes in this release:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>OpenSSL in our binary packages have been updated to 1.0.2k due to [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20170126.txt OpenSSL Security Advisory (26 Jan 2017)]</li>
	<li>Murmur’s -limits command will now print output as it runs, instead of at exit. ([https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/commit/98cd156f0c26be2bacc22d8c64db9c349f16a213 98cd156f0c26be2bacc22d8c64db9c349f16a213])</li>
