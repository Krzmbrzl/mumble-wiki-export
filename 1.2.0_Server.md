# Introduction

This page is supposed to contain information for server owners on what
to expect of the upcoming [1.2.0](1.2.0 "wikilink") release on the
server-side. For specific changes and upgrade instructions from 1.1.8
see [Upgrade](1.2.0_Upgrade "wikilink").

## [Ice](Ice "wikilink")-Interface

1.2.0 contains an enhanced [Ice](Ice "wikilink") interface. This means
more useful information and functionality gets exposed. Please see the
corresponding documentation.

## phpBB3 authenticator

Starting with 1.2.0 we have a [Ice](Ice "wikilink") +
[python](http://www.python.org) implementation of an authenticator that
can be used to authenticate users from a phpBB3 database on a murmur
1.2.0 server. You can find [phpBB3auth
here](http://gitorious.org/mumble-scripts/mumble-scripts/trees/master/Authenticators/phpBB3).
