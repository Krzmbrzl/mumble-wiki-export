<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The Mumble team [https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/releases/tag/1.2.17 has released version 1.2.17] of the Mumble VoIP application. Version 1.2.17 is a bugfix and security release in the stable 1.2-series of Mumble.</p>

<p>This version of Mumble updates our binary packages to use OpenSSL 1.0.2i (from 1.0.1t) due to the [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160922.txt OpenSSL Security Advisory 20160922]. Other dependencies [https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble-releng/tree/master/buildenv/1.2.x have also been updated].</p>

<h3>Changes in this release</h3>
<ul>
	<li>For our binary packages, OpenSSL has been updated to 1.0.2i (from 1.0.1t) because of [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160922.txt OpenSSL Security Advisory 20160922]. The binary releases have been updated to use 1.0.2 rather than 1.0.1 because 1.0.2 will be end-of-life at the end of 2016.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug that could cause the Mumble log view to be inacessible after receiving a specially crafted text message.</li>
	<li>The PulseAudio backend will now fall back to default device if the chosen device is no longer present.</li>
	<li>Mumble now explicitly sends plain text notifications to KDE and Freedesktop.org notification endpoints.</li>
	<li>Xbox One controllers are now properly blacklisted from DirectInput on Windows 10 Anniversary Update.</li>
	<li>Xbox button/controller names as shown by Mumble should now be correct for controllers other than the first controller.</li>
</ul>
