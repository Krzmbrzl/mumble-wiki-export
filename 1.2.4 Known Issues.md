This page lists some of the known issues at the time of the 1.2.4 release.

= Global Shortcuts stop working randomly on Windows =

For some setups, Mumble's global shortcuts will stop working at random on Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8.

This is because Windows implements a timeout on mouse and keyboard hooks, to ensure that crashed or hung applications
cannot interfere with mouse and keyboard input for the whole system.  If a keyboard or mouse hook exceeds this timeout,
the hook will be silently removed by Windows.

Under some circumstances, Mumble's hook will exceed the default timeout of 200 ms.

The timeout can be configured by changing the value of the following registry key:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop\LowLevelHooksTimeout (it does not exist by default)

This key should be of type DWORD, and its value is specified in milliseconds.

You can also use this .reg file, which sets the timeout to 1 second (which should be more than sufficient):
 [http://mumble.info/reg/winhooks-1s-timeout.reg](http://mumble.info/reg/winhooks-1s-timeout.reg)

You will most likely have to reboot your computer after applying the registry fix.


= Resizing the World of Warcraft window on Mac OS X can cause overlay crashes =

The overlay shipped with Mumble 1.2.4 on Mac OS X will cause crashes when used with World of Warcraft (both 32-bit and 64-bit).

The bug is triggered when World of Warcraft is run in windowed mode, and the window is manually resized to be bigger.

We hope to release a fixed overlay installer when the bug is fixed. The bug can be tracked at  [https://sourceforge.net/p/mumble/bugs/986/](https://sourceforge.net/p/mumble/bugs/986/)


= Murmur treats MySQL errors as fatal =

Murmur treats SQL errors as fatal, and as such, will terminate when an SQL error happens.
This is not new behavior, but it is an inconvenience for hosters, since an SQL error in
one virtual host can deny service to all other virtual servers hosted by the Murmur instance.

Steven Hartland has contributed a patch which makes Murmur treat SQL errors as non-fatal
to remedy the situation described above.  The patch has not yet been merged, and must be
patched in manually.

The patch can be found at  [https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/pull/119](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/pull/119).


= Setting the suggestversion config option via Ice =

The suggestversion config option, which will cause a server to suggest a specific Mumble version for use on the server to
its clients, has differing behavior depending on the context in which it is set.

When set via murmur.ini, the suggestversion config option expects a string, such as "1.2.4".

When set via Ice, the suggestversion config option must be set to a bitmasked version number of the form
(1 << 16) + (2 << 8) + 4.

This behavior is confusing for administrators.  The issue is currently tracked at  [https://sourceforge.net/p/mumble/bugs/989/](https://sourceforge.net/p/mumble/bugs/989/),
and a preliminary patch is available at  [https://gist.github.com/fwaggle/584cf2a96002af9d0f64](https://gist.github.com/fwaggle/584cf2a96002af9d0f64).
