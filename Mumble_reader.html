<p>Mumble Reader is a JQuery/Javascript tool which can read <a href="Channel Viewer Protocol">Channel Viewer Protocol</a>. It can also generate CVP using [http://www.zeroc.com/icephp.html ZeroC IcePHP] version 3.3. Currently Mumble Reader's back-end querying tool will not work with the latest version of ZeroC IcePHP (version 3.4), although you can use another CVP provider such as <a href="Mumble PHP Interface">Mumble PHP Interface</a> which does support IcePHP version 3.4. </p>

<p>Edit: Updated the link to github as google code is not working anymore. It should work in 3.4 last time i tried a few years ago. Comments or pull requests are welcome on github.</p>
