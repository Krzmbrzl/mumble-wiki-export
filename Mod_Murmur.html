<p>The details of setting up and using the interface are documented on the <a href="Ice">Ice</a> page. The interface provided by Murmur is described in the [http://mumble.sourceforge.net/slice/?title=slice generated documentation]. Server information is provided in the <a href="Channel Viewer Protocol">Channel Viewer Protocol</a> format as JSON or XML.</p>

<h1>Reading the Database Directly</h1>
<p>{{Warning</p>

<ul>
	<li>First check to see if your server has the SQLite3 PHP library installed.  You can do this by putting a ''&lt;?php phpinfo();'' in a php file and loading it on the server and searching for "SQLite3".</li>
	<li>Get the "[http://www.fsxtools.de/j/downloadslink Mod_murmur.php]" PHP script and if you are like most, you will want to setup a stand alone install and the instructions below are copied from [http://www.fsxtools.de/j/component/kunena/14-coding/11261-murmur-channel-viewer-installation-faq?Itemid=0#11261 here]:</li>
</ul>
<p>Then you only need the mod_murmur.php file (unzip the .zip). Edit it and replace this manually (note the ending slashes!):</p>

<p> $whatpath = "&lt;nowiki&gt;http://path.to/unzippedimages/&lt;/nowiki&gt;";&lt;<br />
 $whatname = "MyServer";<br />
 $dbhost = "/path/to/murmur"; // This is the path where it will look for the murmur.sqlite db!</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mod_murmur has been tested against v1.2.3 of Murmur</li>
</ul>
