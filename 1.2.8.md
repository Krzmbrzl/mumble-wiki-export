Changes in this release:

For binary packages distributed by the Mumble team, OpenSSL has been
updated to 1.0.0n due to [OpenSSL Security Advisory \[06
August 2014](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140806.txt)\]

A PulseAudio issue that could cause the Mumble client to crash on launch
has been fixed.

Various source-level issues that made the Mumble build fail when built
with Clang has been fixed.

The Windows installer, as well as all .EXE and .DLL files are now
code-signed with an Authenticode signature that uses a SHA256 digest in
addition to the previous SHA1-based signature.

The Windows build is now built using the buildenv/1.2.x/win32 build
environment from mumble-releng.
