=mumo - The Mumble moderator=

Mumo is meant to provide a platform on which Python based Mumble server
plugins can be built upon. The goal is to reduce the boilerplate needed
to interact with the Mumble server to a minimum.

To achieve this goal tasks like [[Ice]] interface setup, basic error
handling, configuration management, logging and more are provided
by mumo. Developers can focus on their specific functionality instead.

==Currently mumo comes with the following modules==
===bf2===
Battlefield 2 game management plugin that can dynamically
move players into appropriate channels and groups to fit
the in-game command structure. This is achieved by using
data gathered from Mumble's positional audio system and does
not require cooperation by the game server. 

===idlemove===
Plugin for moving players that have been idle for
a configurable amount of time into a idle channel. Optionally
the players can be muted/deafened on move.

===seen===
Makes the server listen for a configurable keyword to ask for
the last time a specific nick was seen on the server.

===[[mumo_source|source]]===
Source game management plugin that can dynamically move
players into on-the-fly created channel structures representing
in-game team setup. This is achieved by using data gathered from
Mumble's positional audio system and does not require cooperation
by the game server. Currently the following source engine based
games are supported: Team Fortress 2, Day of Defeat: Source,
Counter-Strike: Source, Half-Life 2: Deathmatch.

For more information on how to configure and use the source plugin see [[mumo_source|here]].

===test===
A debugging plugin that registers for all possible events and
outputs every call with parameters into the debug log.

== 3rd Party Modules ==
=== Image Injection Modules ===
==== URL to image ====
[https://github.com/aciid/urltoimg-for-mumo urltoimg on GitHub]

If you send an image URL to the channel, the server fetches it and sends the image instead of the image link to the current channel.

==== Chat Img ====
[https://github.com/aselus-hub/chatimg-mumo chatimg on GitHub]

A more full featured implementation of the same functionality as Url to Image. Allows injection of photos into chat, re-sizing them if they are larger then the size accepted by the mumble protocol and allowing the server admin to set a max width/height for the image so that it is scaled through html or thumbnailing to never be larger then prescribed. Allows the conversion of images within regular chat messages w/o bang commands as an option. Finally the injection of any number of images present after the bang or within a message.

=== Message forwarder ===
[https://github.com/Natenom/mumblemoderator-module-collection/tree/master/messageforwarder messageforwarder on GitHub]

Forwards messages to all linked channels.

=== Anti recording ===
* [https://github.com/Natenom/mumblemoderator-module-collection/tree/master/antirec-contextmenu antirec with contextmenus on GitHub]

If a user starts to record in Mumble they will be deafened or kicked from the server.

=== Max users ===
[https://github.com/ExplodingFist/mumo-maxusers/ mumo-maxusers on GitHub]

=== Sticky ===
* [https://github.com/Natenom/mumblemoderator-module-collection/tree/master/sticky-contextmenu sticky with contextmenus on GitHub]

A user who gets the sticky status can't do more than sitting in one special channel. Even admins will loose their permissions while sticked.

If a user exceeds a limit of actions within a timeframe (both can be changed) they will be kicked from the server.

==Contributions==
If you have a module that you would like to see shipped with mumo or
have any improvements or suggestions please contact us. Whether you
prefer a pull request, visiting us in IRC in #mumble on Freenode or
starting a thread in our forums at http://forums.mumble.info is up to you.

==Configuration==
To configure and run mumo take a look at the mumo.ini and the module
specific configurations in modules-available folder. Enabling modules
is done by linking the configuration in modules-available to the
modules-enabled folder.

==Requirements==
mumo requires:
 - python 2.7*
 - python-zeroc-ice
 - murmur >=1.2.3*
 - murmur >=1.2.4 if you want to use a module which needs user interaction via text commands

* Not tested with lower versions yet

=Installing mumo=
The newest version of mumo is always available from our mumo repository at https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumo .

== Docker==
A docker image can be run with the command:
    docker run --name mumo --net=container:<id_of_mumble_server_container> -d -v /path/to/mumo/folder:/data mumblevoip/mumo
This is the base of the mumo service. It's allow addition of new module.

Warning:
 - the service network-mode is mandatory to link mumble and mumo. Ice need to be in mumble-server localhost.
 - the volume is to store all modules and configurations, you can add yours here. Subfolders will be automatically created ad first start.
 - When you add new modules, you need the restart the container.

Here a docker-compose(v2.4) example:
    mumble-mumo:
        image: mumblevoip/mumo
        container_name: mumble-mumo
        restart: on-failure
        volumes:
            - /path/to/mumo/folder:/data
        network_mode : "service:mumble-server"
        depends_on:
            - mumble-server

==Ubuntu 12.04==
''Note:'' This guide only shows the basic steps for trying out mumo. For a more permanent setup you'll want to run mumo with its own user and a startup script.

* Make sure you are running a recent Murmur release (1.2.4 or later). Ice should be enabled and a writesecret must be set (see configuration file).
* Install dependencies
 sudo apt-get install python-zeroc-ice python-daemon git
* Clone repository
 cd ~/
 git clone https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumo.git
* Adjust configuration
 cd mumo
 nano mumo.ini
In the editor set your server's Ice writesecret as the secret variable so mumo can control your server.
 secret = mysecretwritesecret
Close and save by pressing Ctrl + X followed by Y and Enter.
* Configure the modules you want to use by editing their ini file in the modules-available folder
* Enable modules by linking their config file into the modules-enabled folder
 cd modules-enabled
 ln -s ../modules-available/moduleyouwanttouse.ini
* Run mumo
 ./mumo.py

Mumo should now be working with your mumble server. If it doesn't work check the ''mumo.log'' file for more information.
