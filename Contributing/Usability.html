<p>''Concerning the contributed document 'Mumble Usability Improvements Report 2015.pdf'''.</p>

<h3>1.1:</h3>
<p>That back button is actually windows wizard style as per windows guidelines. (I agree it sucks.)</p>

<p>TODO: Link to guidelines.</p>

<h3>1.2:</h3>

<p>Agreed. I didn't actually know this before I checked, but on Linux we actually have high contrast mode for the Volume tuning step in the audio wizard.</p>

<p>TODO: Check if we can't just switch colors. Which colors are an issue? What would we switch to?</p>

<p>TODO: (Link to) General color guidelines.</p>

<h3>1.3: Activation description.</h3>

<p>Agreed.</p>

<h3>1.4 Audio out test button</h3>


<h3>1.5 Mic input volume display.</h3>

<p>Agreed. A further optimization may be to display volumes of all possible selections, like windows does, to make it easier to *find* the correct device (rather than going through them individually).</p>

<h3>1.6 PA</h3>


<h3>1.7 Page numbers</h3>

<p>I’m not sure about these. Does any other setup/wizard do these? What for? Maybe for referencing someone to a specific page.</p>

<h3>1.8 Slider steps</h3>

<p>Sure; check how this is filled, and see if we can just display *all* discrete values.</p>

<h2>2 Main window</h2>

<h3>2.1 minimal view</h3>

<p>Agreed. Too hard to find; we do occasionally get support request of users not getting out of it.</p>

<h3>2.2 access tokens</h3>


<h3>2.3 Help section on main window</h3>
<p>Good idea</p>

<h3>2.4 Transmission feedback, colorblind</h3>

<h3>2.5 channel hierarchy</h3>

<p>We already use italic for linked channels, so that’s not really an option.</p>

<p>Leading guidelines may improve this, or visual borders/blocks.</p>

<h3>2.6 error messages</h3>

<p>Yeah, these are known to sometimes lack information/be confusing.</p>

<p>Needs further analysis.</p>

<h3>2.7 Systray</h3>

<p>I don’t think we need connect and disconnect there.</p>

<h3>2.8 What's This</h3>

<p>Should definitely be in main window then. Can it be done? (Settings is a modal dialog, without maximization/minimization buttons)</p>

<h3>2.9 Add server label descriptive hint</h3>


<h3>2.10 UI icons</h3>

<p>Not sure which icon specifically is being talked about.</p>


<h2>3 Settings</h2>

<h3>3.1 PTT Hotkey Assign Button</h3>

<p>Absolutely!</p>


<h3>3.2 Shortcut key hint</h3>


<h3>3.3 Reset vs Restore</h3>

<p>Yeah, Reset is not really intuitively descriptive; but neither is "Restore Previous". Not sure if this does even do anything different from simply cancelling; does it just for the current page?</p>


<h3>3.4 Greyed out apply on no changes</h3>

<p>Sure, could be a bit of work code-wise though; dunno.</p>


<h3>3.5 Shortcut for local recording.</h3>


<h3>3.6 Messages column naming</h3>

<p>Sure, agreed, good argumentation.</p>


<h3>3.7 Overlay settings</h3>

<p>Yes, it is overly complicated.</p>


<h2>4 OS X</h2>


<h3>4.1 What's This is missing</h3>
