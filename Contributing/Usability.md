''Concerning the contributed document 'Mumble Usability Improvements Report 2015.pdf'''.

### 1.1: 
That back button is actually windows wizard style as per windows guidelines. (I agree it sucks.)

TODO: Link to guidelines.

### 1.2: 

Agreed. I didn't actually know this before I checked, but on Linux we actually have high contrast mode for the Volume tuning step in the audio wizard.

TODO: Check if we can't just switch colors. Which colors are an issue? What would we switch to?

TODO: (Link to) General color guidelines.

### 1.3: Activation description. 

Agreed.

### 1.4 Audio out test button 


### 1.5 Mic input volume display. 

Agreed. A further optimization may be to display volumes of all possible selections, like windows does, to make it easier to *find* the correct device (rather than going through them individually).

### 1.6 PA 


### 1.7 Page numbers 

I’m not sure about these. Does any other setup/wizard do these? What for? Maybe for referencing someone to a specific page.

### 1.8 Slider steps 

Sure; check how this is filled, and see if we can just display *all* discrete values.

## 2 Main window 

### 2.1 minimal view 

Agreed. Too hard to find; we do occasionally get support request of users not getting out of it.

### 2.2 access tokens 


### 2.3 Help section on main window 
Good idea

### 2.4 Transmission feedback, colorblind 

### 2.5 channel hierarchy 

We already use italic for linked channels, so that’s not really an option.

Leading guidelines may improve this, or visual borders/blocks.

### 2.6 error messages 

Yeah, these are known to sometimes lack information/be confusing.

Needs further analysis.

### 2.7 Systray 

I don’t think we need connect and disconnect there.

### 2.8 What's This 

Should definitely be in main window then. Can it be done? (Settings is a modal dialog, without maximization/minimization buttons)

### 2.9 Add server label descriptive hint 


### 2.10 UI icons 

Not sure which icon specifically is being talked about.


## 3 Settings 

### 3.1 PTT Hotkey Assign Button 

Absolutely!


### 3.2 Shortcut key hint 


### 3.3 Reset vs Restore 

Yeah, Reset is not really intuitively descriptive; but neither is "Restore Previous". Not sure if this does even do anything different from simply cancelling; does it just for the current page?


### 3.4 Greyed out apply on no changes 

Sure, could be a bit of work code-wise though; dunno.


### 3.5 Shortcut for local recording. 


### 3.6 Messages column naming 

Sure, agreed, good argumentation.


### 3.7 Overlay settings 

Yes, it is overly complicated.




## 4 OS X 


### 4.1 What's This is missing
