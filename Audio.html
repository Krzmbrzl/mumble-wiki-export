<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Mumble features various Audio Options and Features, this wiki page will describe them and tell you which settings are best for your setup.</p>

<h1>Audio Input - Options</h1>

<h2>Interface</h2>

<h3>Echo Cancellation</h3>

<p>If enabled, this will filter echo from the audio you send to others.&lt;br&gt;</p>

<p>You should enable it in the following cases: &lt;br&gt;<br />
1. You use conventional loudspeakers and no headset:&lt;br&gt;<br />
This Setup will usually create echo, so you will need echo cancellation.</p>

<p>2. Headset transmits echo, though it shouldn't: &lt;br&gt;<br />
Some Headsets tend to transmit echo, the reasons for this include: bad cable and noise isolation or the microphone is to close to the loudspeakers of the headset.</p>

<p>Two options are implemented (you can choose one of them): &lt;br&gt;<br />

	<td>1. Mixed echo cancellation</td>
	<td>This is the basic Option: It will process all loudspeaker outputs bundled together. &lt;br&gt;This is less accurate than the Multichannel option, but will also use less CPU.</td>
	<td>Sufficient for setups with loudspeakers near to the microphone.</td>

	<td>2. Multichannel echo cancellation</td>
	<td>Extended option: It will process all audio channels seperately, this is more accurate, but will result in higher CPU usage.</td>
	<td>For setups with (multiple) loudspeakers farther away from the microphone.</td>
</tr>

<p>In case of doubt: &lt;br&gt;<br />
1. Try ''Mixed echo cancellation'' first. &lt;br&gt;<br />
2. If ''Mixed echo cancellation'' does not filter the echo correctly, try ''Multichannel echo cancellation''. &lt;br&gt;</p>


<p>'''Alternatives:'''&lt;br&gt;<br />
You can also use external echo filters.</p>

<h2>Audio Processing</h2>

<h3>RNNoise</h3>

<p>RNNoise is a noise suppression library.&lt;br&gt;<br />
It is intended to filter background noises from the audio that is sent to other users.&lt;br&gt;<br />
RNNoise uses a deep learning algorithm so it should work better than most regular filters.</p>
