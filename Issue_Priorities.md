| priority/P0 - Blocker            | MUST be fixed ASAP. Issues that prevent further development; legal issues; serious data loss issues; build issues for platforms we provide binaries for.                                                                                                                                                |
| priority/P1 - Critical           | Urgent and Important, will STOP the release; Regressions from the last version that are not edge cases; Data loss; FTBFS for platforms we don't provide binaries for; All but the most unlikely crashes/lockups/hanging; Serious usability issues and embarrassing bugs; Bugs critical to a deliverable |
| priority/P2 - Important          | Not Urgent, should be fixed, but will not stop the release.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| priority/P3 - Somewhat important | Can be fixed, but doesn't affect the release in any way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| priority/P4 - Low                | Would be nice to fix, but it's not very important.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| priority/P5 - Not important      | Not relevant and not urgent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
