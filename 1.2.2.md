### Improvements

* Servers using trusted certificates are now highlighted in green throughout the GUI.
* CELT version bump; possible quality improvements as a result, on certain configurations
* LOTRO, L4D2, and ArmA2 plugins
* Replaced user-textures with avatars to make overlay more useful
* Better overlay system on Win32 using the pipe method
* Numerous GUI improvements, including consolidating and reorganizing the main window menus
* Logitech G15 fixes and improvements
* Made friend and server window icons skinnable (emblem-favorite.svg, etc, see [[Skinning]])
* Other small changes here and there

### Bug fixes 

This list contains notable bugs we fixed since the last release.

* [[Bonjour]] LAN server discovery and resolving works again
* G15 activation problems
* memory leak on certain configurations
* many other minor fixes

## Murmur 

* Protected local [[Ice]] sockets using the '''icesecret.ini''' parameter in the '''[[murmur.ini]]''' file; this  makes [[Ice]] much more secure on a shared-host server without having to use Glacier.
* Fixed a database upgrade bug (only occured when updating from 1.1.8 directly to 1.2.1)
