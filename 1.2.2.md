### User Information dialog

![user_information.png](user_information.png "user_information.png") We
added a new dialog displaying useful information about other users on
the server (e.g. packet loss). Depending on your privileges, you can
also inspect the users' certificates and see their IP addresses. Note
that the server has to be version 1.2.2 or greater for the client to be
able to display this dialog.



### Toolbar

![toolbar.png](toolbar.png "toolbar.png") The new release features a
toolbar for easy access to commonly used functionality like mute and
deafen.



### Improvements

  - Improved connect speed to large servers with lots of users and
    comments (needs updated server) through use of local caching of
    content
  - Servers using trusted certificates are now highlighted in green
    throughout the GUI.
  - CELT version bump; possible quality improvements as a result, on
    certain configurations
  - LOTRO, L4D2, and ArmA2 plugins
  - Replaced user-textures with avatars to make overlay more useful
  - Better overlay system on Win32 using the pipe method
  - Numerous GUI improvements, including consolidating and reorganizing
    the main window menus
  - Logitech G15 fixes and improvements
  - Made friend and server window icons skinnable (emblem-favorite.svg,
    etc, see [Skinning](Skinning "wikilink"))
  - Other small changes here and there

### Bug fixes

This list contains notable bugs we fixed since the last release.

  - [Bonjour](Bonjour "wikilink") LAN server discovery and resolving
    works again
  - G15 activation problems
  - memory leak on certain configurations
  - many other minor fixes

## Murmur

  - Protected local [Ice](Ice "wikilink") sockets using the
    **icesecret.ini** parameter in the
    **[murmur.ini](murmur.ini "wikilink")** file; this makes
    [Ice](Ice "wikilink") much more secure on a shared-host server
    without having to use Glacier.
  - Fixed a database upgrade bug (only occured when updating from 1.1.8
    directly to 1.2.1)
