<p>'''This page contains only some highlighted changes. Please refer to the [https://www.mumble.info/blog/mumble-1.3.0-release-announcement/ 1.3.0 release announcement] instead.'''</p>

<p>'''Mumble 1.3.0''' has been released 2019-08-08. You can download it from our [https://www.mumble.info/downloads/ Downloads page].</p>

<p>Almost 10 years of development mean 1.3.0 has a LOT of changes.</p>

<h2>Improved user management</h2>
<h3>User list</h3>
<p><a href="File:Screenshot mumble 1.3.0 usermanagement.png">250px|left</a><br />
To simplify the administration of servers with a lot of users Mumble 1.3.0 ships with an improved userlist manager in the client. The new manager displays nick, time since the user was last seen* as well as the channel the user was last seen in*. You can sort the display on all those values and apply filtering by username and/or time since the user last joined the server to quickly find the user you want to edit. The new interface allows renaming users as well as (batch) deletions.</p>

<p>&lt;small&gt;* requires server version &gt;=1.3.0&lt;/small&gt;<br />
&lt;br style="clear:both"/&gt;</p>

<h3>Renaming users</h3>
<p>Renaming a user in the user list no longer requires the user to disconnect and reconnect in order to use the new name.</p>

<h2>Improved banlist management</h2>
<p><a href="File:Screenshot mumble 1.3.0 banlist.png">250px|left</a><br />
With the improved banlist you can add, search, view and edit existing bans much easier than in previous versions of Mumble.</p>

<p>&lt;br style="clear:both"/&gt;</p>

<h2>Avatar handling</h2>
<p>An admin can now remove the avatar of a user.</p>

<h2>Dynamic channel filtering</h2>
<p><a href="File:Screenshot mumble 1.3.0 filter.gif">left</a><br />
The dynamic channel filtering feature enables you to effectively navigate big mumble servers with lots of users and channels. You can toggle the filter by pressing the filter icon in the icon bar or by pressing [Ctrl+F]. By default the filter will hide all empty channels on the server from your channel tree. Additionally you can right-click channels and add them to your explicit filter list. If the dynamic filter is enabled channels on this list will be hidden even if users are currently residing in them.<br />
&lt;br style="clear:both"/&gt;</p>
