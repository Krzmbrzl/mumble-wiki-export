{{Building}}

=== Introduction ===

This guide describes the method to get a fully working and redistributable version of Mumble and Murmur that uses the Cocoa version of Qt 4.

To build Mumble you will need:
* Mac OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion)
* Xcode 4.4

=== Creating a build environment ===

The git repository at https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble-releng contains pre-made scripts that build the current canonical Mumble OS X build environment.

Simply clone the repo, and cd into it:

  $ git clone https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble-releng
  $ cd mumble-releng/buildenv/1.3.x/osx

Create a MumbleBuild directory in your home dir:

  $ mkdir -p ~/MumbleBuild

Copy the 'env' script to the directory you created in the previous step:

  $ cp env ~/MumbleBuild/env

Source the env script to set up the proper environment variables for the Mumble build environment:

  $ source ~/MumbleBuild/env

Build the enviroment:

  $ ./build-all.bash

Once this is done, you should have a fully functional installation of Mumble's dependencies (tools and libs) in a self-contained MumbleBuild directory in your home directory.

=== Building Mumble ===

Make sure you've sourced ~/MumbleBuild/env into your current shell session:

 $ source ~/MumbleBuild/env

Fetch the Mumble source from Git into a directory of your choosing:

 git clone --recursive https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble

To build the client, execute:

 cd mumble
 qmake -recursive -Wall main.pro CONFIG+="release static"
 make

If everything went well, you should now have a Mumble.app application bundle in the release directory of the root of the source tree.

=== Building Murmur ===

Make sure you've sourced ~/MumbleBuild/env into your current shell session:

 $ source ~/MumbleBuild/env

Fetch the Mumble and Murmur source from Git into a directory of your choosing:

 git clone --recursive https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble

To build the server, execute:

 cd mumble
 qmake -spec unsupported/macx-clang -recursive CONFIG+="release static no-client no-dbus"
 make

If everything went well, you should now have a murmur binary in the release directory of the root of the source tree.

=== Distributing Mumble ===

If you wish to create a proper redistributable Mumble application bundle, please refer to the osxdist.py script in
the macx/scripts directory. This will help you clean up your application bundle, include the needed dependencies, resources etc., and create a compressed disk image - ready to redistribute!

The script expects you to be in the root of the source tree. After executing, it will spit out a .dmg of your Mumble build in the release folder.

If you only have a Mumble.app, and have not built Murmur, you should also pass the

 --no-server

parameter to the osxdist.py script. This will not attempt to package Murmur-specific files in the generated .dmg.

The script supports code signing, and among other things, allow you to build a copy of Mumble signed with your Developer ID certificates from Apple.
To build with code signing enabled, use the following three parameters to the osxdist.py script:

* --developer-id='<Name or Organization>'
* --keychain=<keychain> (optional, defaults to 'login.keychain')
