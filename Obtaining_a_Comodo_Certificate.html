<p>Servers identify themselves with a different kind of certificate. If you are looking for server certificates, this guide is not for you.</p>

<h2>I cannot connect after installing my certificate</h2>

<p>If you cannot connect and "SSL Error: The root CA certificate is not trusted for this purpose" is logged to the server log, this is usually due to having an incomplete certificate bundle.</p>

<p>Please export the certificate using Firefox and try again.  Chrome and Safari are known to create incomplete certificate bundles.</p>
