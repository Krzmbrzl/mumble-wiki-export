<h2>Mumble Universal Binaries for Mac OS X</h2>

<p>Since the 1.2.3 release of Mumble, the default packaging for Mac OS X only includes 64-bit Intel (X86-64) binaries for Mumble and Murmur.<br />
The reason behind this move was that the majority Macs sold since the switch to Intel processors (that is, except the first generation of the<br />
various Mac families and the Mac Mini) have X86-64 support.</p>

<p>Universal binaries that are built to run on 32-bit Intel (i386) and PowerPC (ppc) are still provided, but don't include all extra "nice-to-have" features<br />
such as the overlay.</p>


<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Mac OS X 10.4 or greater</li>
	<li>32-bit Intel or 32-bit PowerPC CPU</li>
</ul>

<p>If you find that they do not work for you given the above requirements, *please* file a bug on the [https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=147372&amp;atid=768005 bug tracker] or talk to us on [irc://irc.freenode.org/mumble IRC].</p>

<p>Snapshots are also regularly made available, though perhaps not as rapidly as the 64-bit versions are. They can be found in the snapshot folder of mumble.info:</p>

<p><a href="http://mumble.info/snapshot/">http://mumble.info/snapshot/</a></p>

<p>All universal snapshots follow the naming scheme Mumble-Universal-Snapshot-VERSION.dmg, where VERSION is an internal description of the version of the snapshot.<br />
(It is the output of 'git describe' at build-time.)</p>
