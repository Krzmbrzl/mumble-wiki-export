### Other changes 
* Display of the full blown client user interface inside the overlay. On the Windows platform it is fully interactive just like the desktop client. (This feature is '''EXPERIMENTAL''')

* Updated CELT Codec to version 0.11.0 which improves audio quality for low bandwidth settings  [changes)](http://git.xiph.org/?p=celt.git (CELT)

* Optional auto reconnect to last used server

* The client is now able to operate in WASAPI exclusive mode. This drops the latency overhead of the audio output considerably but has the disadvantage that no other application can input/output sound from that device. ( [information](http://blog.mumble.info/oh-no-weve-made-a-buzzword/ see our blog for more))
