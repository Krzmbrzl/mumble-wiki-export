<p>NOTE: Since Mumble version 1.3 there is no advanced mode anymore. You will see all settings in the settings dialog.</p>

<p>Mumble shows the most important client options only in settings dialog. To show all options, click on "Configure" -&gt; "Settings" and check "Advanced" in the bottom left corner.</p>
