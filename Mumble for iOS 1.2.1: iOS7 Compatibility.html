<p>This Wiki page lists the known iOS 7 compatibility issues with the current release of Mumble for iOS, version 1.2.1.</p>

<h1>No audio being recorded</h1>

<p>On some devices (such as iPhone 4S) running Mumble for iOS 1.2.1 on iOS 7 can cause the app to not be able to record.</p>

<p>Note however, that not all devices are affected of this issue. For example, a 3rd generation iPad works just fine.</p>

<p>If you experience this issue, you can work around it by disabling Echo Cancellation in the Preferences:</p>

<ul>
	<li>On the main screen, tap on the 'Preferences' button.</li>
	<li>In Preferences, tap "Advanced".</li>
	<li>In the Advanced Audio preferences, set 'Echo Cancellation' to off.</li>
</ul>
<p>This should fix the issue -- however, an updated version of Mumble for iOS will soon be available that fixes this in general.</p>

<p>If you do not wish to disable Echo Cancellation, you can also work around the issue by entering and exiting the app's Preferences. (This causes a restart of the app's audio engine.)</p>
