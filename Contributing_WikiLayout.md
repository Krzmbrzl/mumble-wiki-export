This is a [contribution](Contributing "wikilink") page for refactoring
the wiki and contributing suggestions to the layout.

## Wanted – Styles

please add CSS

` .note { padding:0px 2px; margin:4px 0px 2px; }`

The the coresponding templates
([Template:Warning](Template:Warning "wikilink"),
[Template:Notice](Template:Notice "wikilink"),
[Template:Elaboration](Template:Elaboration "wikilink"))

## New Layout

We’re looking for an entirely new and unique layout\! Please suggest one
to us\!

## General

  - Headlines are IMHO too big compared to text. Makes text hard to read
    on articles with a lot of headlines (like all these contribution
    pages).
  - Kissaki volunteers to cleaning up HTML and CSS (with or without IE
    being low priority and IE6 maybe getting dropped? \*hope\*)

## MainPage

  - <s>either change the wiki mainpage to link to
    [Contributing](Contributing "wikilink") instead of
    [Development](Development "wikilink") or before it</s>✓

<!-- end list -->

  - the headline "Get Involved" doesn't fit for just the 2 links forums
    and irc. What I get from that headline is more than getting in
    contact. More like getting involved in the project. Which is what
    [Contributing](Contributing "wikilink") is for.

**releases block**:

  - **link** *See your distro repository for clients* to [Installing
    Mumble](Installing_Mumble "wikilink")
  - change *Windows:* to *Windows (Client & Server Installer):* to make
    it clear the installer includes both
  - remove useless \<dd\> element
  - change block to a table. Now that we have release candidates dunno
    about third column. anyway, here goes suggestion:
