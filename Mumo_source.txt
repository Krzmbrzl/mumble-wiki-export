The Source game management plugin for [[Mumo]] can dynamically move players into on-the-fly created channel structures representing in-game team setup. This is achieved by using data gathered from Mumble's [[Positional-Audio|positional audio system]] and does not require cooperation by the game server. Currently the following source engine based games are supported:
* Team Fortress 2
* Day of Defeat: Source
* Counter-Strike: Source
* Half-Life 2: Deathmatch.

=Requirements=
* Working [[Mumo]] installation.

=Getting started=
* Link or copy the ''source.ini'' file from the modules-available folder into the modules-enabled folder
 cd modules-enabled
 ln -s ../modules-available/source.ini
* Check whether the defaults in ''source.ini'' are ok for your setup. They should be sane for basic setups.
* Restart mumo
* Done
