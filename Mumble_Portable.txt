The Mumble client can be installed portable on an USB stick or into a directory on your PC.

Reasons for Mumble portable are:
* Creating audio bots
* Using different client settings for different servers
* Using Mumble on other PCs without installation

Be aware that [[Mumble_URL|Mumble-URLs]] cannot be used with a portable Mumble because there is no URL handler.

==Mumble portable on different operating systems==
The howtos for creating a Mumble portable are splitted into the three main operating systems:
* [[Mumble_Portable_Windows|Mumble portable on Windows]]
* [[Mumble_Portable_Mac_OS_X|Mumble portable on Mac OS X]]
* [[Mumble_Portable_Linux|Mumble portable on Linux]]

==Technical Background==
On start Mumble checks whether there is a file mumble.ini in the same directory the Mumble binary is in ([https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/blob/1.2.4/src/mumble/Global.cpp#L125 source code]). If so, the client uses this file to store settings and creates a SQLite database in the same directory.
