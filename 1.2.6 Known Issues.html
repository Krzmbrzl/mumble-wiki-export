<p>This page lists some of the known issues at the time of the <a href="1.2.6">1.2.6</a> release.</p>

<h1>Cannot connect to any Mumble servers, "remote host closed connection"</h1>

<p>This can happen due to a bad interaction between Mumble and Skype's click-to-call feature.<br />
Please install the latest client update to Mumble 1.2.7 or greater to apply this fix.<br />
A special thanks to everyone at Mumble.com/GameVox.com for troubleshooting and finding a fix fix this issue over a four week timespan.</p>

<h1>Mumble on Windows may hang on some computers that use ASIO sound drivers</h1>
<p>Some computers with ASIO sound drivers can cause Mumble 1.2.6 to hang on startup.<br />
See the following bug for more information: <a href="https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/issues/1151">https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/issues/1151</a></p>

<p>For <a href="1.2.5">1.2.5</a> release, we had a special binary built without ASIO support available for download. This has not yet been built for 1.2.6. If this is a problem, please report an issue.</p>

<h1>Global Shortcuts stop working randomly on Windows</h1>
<p>For some setups, Mumble's global shortcuts will stop working at random on Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8.</p>

<p>This is because Windows implements a timeout on mouse and keyboard hooks, to ensure that crashed or hung applications<br />
cannot interfere with mouse and keyboard input for the whole system.  If a keyboard or mouse hook exceeds this timeout,<br />
the hook will be silently removed by Windows.</p>

<p>Under some circumstances, Mumble's hook will exceed the default timeout of 200 ms.</p>

<p>The timeout can be configured by changing the value of the following registry key:</p>

<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop\LowLevelHooksTimeout (it does not exist by default)</p>

<p>This key should be of type DWORD, and its value is specified in milliseconds.</p>

<p>You can also use this .reg file, which sets the timeout to 1 second (which should be more than sufficient):<br />
[http://mumble.info/reg/winhooks-1s-timeout.reg <a href="http://mumble.info/reg/winhooks-1s-timeout.reg]">http://mumble.info/reg/winhooks-1s-timeout.reg]</a></p>

<p>You will most likely have to reboot your computer after applying the registry fix.</p>

<h1>Resizing the World of Warcraft window on Mac OS X can cause overlay crashes</h1>

<p>The overlay shipped with Mumble 1.2.6 on Mac OS X will cause crashes when used with World of Warcraft (both 32-bit and 64-bit).</p>

<p>The bug is triggered when World of Warcraft is run in windowed mode, and the window is manually resized to be bigger.</p>

<p>We hope to release a fixed overlay installer when the bug is fixed. The bug can be tracked at [https://sourceforge.net/p/mumble/bugs/986/ <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/mumble/bugs/986/]">https://sourceforge.net/p/mumble/bugs/986/]</a></p>

<h1>Murmur treats MySQL errors as fatal</h1>

<p>Murmur treats SQL errors as fatal, and as such, will terminate when an SQL error happens.<br />
This is not new behavior, but it is an inconvenience for hosters, since an SQL error in<br />
one virtual host can deny service to all other virtual servers hosted by the Murmur instance.</p>

<p>Steven Hartland has contributed a patch which makes Murmur treat SQL errors as non-fatal<br />
to remedy the situation described above.  The patch has not yet been merged, and must be<br />
patched in manually.</p>

<p>The patch can be found at [https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/pull/119 <a href="https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/pull/119].">https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/pull/119].</a></p>

<h1>Setting the suggestversion config option via Ice</h1>

<p>The suggestversion config option, which will cause a server to suggest a specific Mumble version for use on the server to<br />
its clients, has differing behavior depending on the context in which it is set.</p>

<p>When set via murmur.ini, the suggestversion config option expects a string, such as "1.2.6".</p>

<p>When set via Ice, the suggestversion config option must be set to a bitmasked version number of the form<br />
(1 &lt;&lt; 16) + (2 &lt;&lt; 8) + 4.</p>

<p>This behavior is confusing for administrators.  The issue is currently tracked at [https://sourceforge.net/p/mumble/bugs/989/ <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/mumble/bugs/989/],">https://sourceforge.net/p/mumble/bugs/989/],</a><br />
and a preliminary patch is available at [https://gist.github.com/fwaggle/584cf2a96002af9d0f64 <a href="https://gist.github.com/fwaggle/584cf2a96002af9d0f64].">https://gist.github.com/fwaggle/584cf2a96002af9d0f64].</a></p>
