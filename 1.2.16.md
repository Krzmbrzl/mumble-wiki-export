### Summary

Mumble 1.2.16 is a bugfix release (and security release for official
binary users) in the 1.2-series of Mumble. Official binary releases of
1.2.16 include OpenSSL 1.0.1t which addresses the vulnerabilities in the
[20160503 OpenSSL Security
Advisory](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160503.txt). 1.2.16 also
includes changes to XInput polling, an update to Mumble service
hostnames, and a backport of the overlay blacklist from
[1.3.0](1.3.0 "wikilink").

### Changes in this release

  - For our binary packages, OpenSSL has been updated to 1.0.1t because
    of [OpenSSL Security
    Advisory 20160503](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160503.txt)
  - Mumble will no longer try to poll for changes in XInput button state
    when no controllers are connected.
  - The last references (public server list registration and crash
    reporting) to the old domain name for the Mumble service host,
    "mumble.hive.no", have been changed to use "mumble.info" instead.
  - The overlay blacklist from 1.3.0 snapshots has been backported to
    1.2.16.
