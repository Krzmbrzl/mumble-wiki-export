### Summary 
The Mumble team  [1.2.17](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/releases/tag/1.2.17 has released version) of the Mumble VoIP application. Version 1.2.17 is a bugfix and security release in the stable 1.2-series of Mumble.

This version of Mumble updates our binary packages to use OpenSSL 1.0.2i (from 1.0.1t) due to the  [20160922](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160922.txt OpenSSL Security Advisory). Other dependencies  [updated](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble-releng/tree/master/buildenv/1.2.x have also been).

### Changes in this release 
* For our binary packages, OpenSSL has been updated to 1.0.2i (from 1.0.1t) because of  [20160922](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160922.txt OpenSSL Security Advisory). The binary releases have been updated to use 1.0.2 rather than 1.0.1 because 1.0.2 will be end-of-life at the end of 2016.
* Fixed a bug that could cause the Mumble log view to be inacessible after receiving a specially crafted text message.
* The PulseAudio backend will now fall back to default device if the chosen device is no longer present.
* Mumble now explicitly sends plain text notifications to KDE and Freedesktop.org notification endpoints.
* Xbox One controllers are now properly blacklisted from DirectInput on Windows 10 Anniversary Update.
* Xbox button/controller names as shown by Mumble should now be correct for controllers other than the first controller.
