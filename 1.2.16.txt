=== Summary ===
Mumble 1.2.16 is a bugfix release (and security release for official binary users) in the 1.2-series of Mumble. Official binary releases of 1.2.16 include OpenSSL 1.0.1t which addresses the vulnerabilities in the [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160503.txt 20160503 OpenSSL Security Advisory]. 1.2.16 also includes changes to XInput polling, an update to Mumble service hostnames, and a backport of the overlay blacklist from [[1.3.0]].

=== Changes in this release ===

* For our binary packages, OpenSSL has been updated to 1.0.1t because of [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160503.txt OpenSSL Security Advisory 20160503]
* Mumble will no longer try to poll for changes in XInput button state when no controllers are connected.
* The last references (public server list registration and crash reporting) to the old domain name for the Mumble service host, "mumble.hive.no", have been changed to use "mumble.info" instead.
* The overlay blacklist from 1.3.0 snapshots has been backported to 1.2.16.
