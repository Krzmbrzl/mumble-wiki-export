<p>MurmurCL is a basic console interface to some of the functionality the murmur server exposes via the <a href="Ice">Ice</a> RPC mechanism.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>The help command</h3>
<p>If you want to get information about a command the help function is very useful. It can be called with one or zero parameters. If you call it without any parameters it looks like this:<br />
   console&gt; ./murmurcl.py help</p>

<p>       Displays this help<br />
       usage: help [command]</p>

<p>   Available commands: ['addchannel', 'listplayers', 'addserver', 'cfgserver', 'listservers', 'listchannels', 'startserver'<br />
   , 'addplayer', 'cfgplayer', 'delchannel', 'delplayer', 'stopserver', 'delserver']<br />
If you want information about a specific command just use it's name as the paramter for help.<br />
   console&gt; ./murmurcl.py help addserver</p>

<p>       Add a new virtual server to the murmur instance<br />
       usage: addserver [port]</p>


<h3>Setting a default channel</h3>
<p>Mumble has some features which are not accessible via the default graphical user interface. One of them is setting a default channels players will join when they connect to the server. This can be done by setting the defaultchannel paramter for a server.</p>

<p>To do this we first have to find out the port of our server, you usually know this but let's say you don't.   <br />
   console&gt; ./murmurcl.py listservers<br />
   ==================================================<br />
   Id              Port            Running<br />
   ==================================================<br />
   1               64738           True</p>

<p>After that we have to find out the id of the channel you want to set as default.<br />
   console&gt; ./murmurcl.py listchannels 64738<br />
   ==================================================<br />
   Id      Parent  Name<br />
   ==================================================<br />
   0       -1      Root<br />
   1       0       A channel<br />
Ok, now we have the id of "A channel", let's make it the new default:<br />
   console&gt; ./murmurcl.py cfgserver defaultchannel 1 on 64738<br />
   'defaultchannel' set to '1' on server 64738</p>

<p>Now new players will always join "A channel" instead of "Root". Be aware that this doesn't work on clients which choose their default channels themselves.</p>
