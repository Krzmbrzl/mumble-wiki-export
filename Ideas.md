This pages is for all sorts of ideas and musings that started in
\#mumble, mostly on improving usability.
The intention of improvements on this page are to increase the potential
user base and decrease the barrier to entry for Mumble.
If an average, non-technical user asks "why does this X," or gets
frustrated with something, it should end up here.

## UI Rework

Some of these areas touch on improving the UI. pcgod and myself
(crazedfred) have noted some Microsoft User Interface guidelines that
may be relevant:
[one](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms997506.aspx)
[two](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511258.aspx)

The Inductive User Interface has these guidelines:

  - Focus each page on a single task
  - State the task
  - Make the page's contents suit the task
  - Offer links to secondary tasks

The Windows User Experience Design Principles are a bit more specific:

  - Nail the basics
  - Design experiences, not features
  - Be great at something
  - Don't be all things to all people
  - Make the hard decisions
  - Make the experience like a friendly conversation
  - Do the right thing by default
  - Make it just work
  - Ask questions carefully
  - Make it a pleasure to use
  - Make it a pleasure to see
  - Make it responsive
  - Keep it simple
  - Avoid bad experiences
  - Design for common problems
  - Don't be annoying
  - Reduce effort, knowledge, and thought
  - Follow the guidelines
  - Test your UI

### Audio wizard

I feel like an overwhelming majority of users will click "next" through
the wizard until they're "allowed" to connect to something.
A large portion of personal experience with VoIP setups are typically
in-game; eg, a new user needs to connect to VoIP as fast as possible.
This person is not interested in complicated configurations, typically
has people wait on them, and wants it to get working ASAP.
