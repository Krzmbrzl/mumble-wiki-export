== About ==
Voice Comms Viewer is a site which allows you to create a Channel Viewer for Mumble, Teamspeak & Ventrilo by filling in a simple form with the details of your server.
Once created you can place the small code block on your site where visitors can see the state of you server and join directly by clicking on the relevant links.

Voice Comms Viewer makes use of the standard [[Channel Viewer Protocol]] to provide support for Mumble servers.
