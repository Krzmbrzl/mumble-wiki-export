The G-keys available on many [Logitech
keyboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Logitech_products#Gaming_Keyboards)
can be used as keyboard shortcuts in Mumble 1.3.0 and later.

## First-time setup

1.  Install the [Logitech Gaming Software
    (LGS)](http://support.logitech.com/en_ca/software/gaming-software).
    If you already have it installed, make sure the version is newer
    than 8.55 -- If it is older, upgrade.
2.  Start LGS
3.  Start or restart mumble
4.  Open the LGS window ![Open-lgs.png](Open-lgs.png "Open-lgs.png")
5.  Open the G-keys view ![Open-gkeys-border.png](Open-gkeys-border.png
    "Open-gkeys-border.png")
6.  You should see that a "mumble" profile has been created

    "Mumble-profile-detail.png")
7.  Right click the mumble profile and select **"Set as Default"** or
    **"Set as Persistent"**.
    This is required due to limitations of the Logitech G-key API, since
    it was designed for use only with games in mind. *We recommend
    setting the mumble profile as default.* For more information, see
    "What are persistent and default profiles?" in the LGS help by
    clicking on the "?" icon on the LGS window, or in [the online manual
    (PDF)(page 54)](http://www.logitech.com/assets/51813/3/lgs-guide.pdf).
    *If mumble is not set as the default or persistent profile, then
    your keys will not be active unless mumble is the active window.*

8.  In mumble, you should now be able to set G-keys as your shortcut
