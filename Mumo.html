<h1>mumo - The Mumble moderator</h1>

<p>Mumo is meant to provide a platform on which Python based Mumble server<br />
plugins can be built upon. The goal is to reduce the boilerplate needed<br />
to interact with the Mumble server to a minimum.</p>

<p>To achieve this goal tasks like <a href="Ice">Ice</a> interface setup, basic error<br />
handling, configuration management, logging and more are provided<br />
by mumo. Developers can focus on their specific functionality instead.</p>

<h2>Currently mumo comes with the following modules</h2>
<h3>bf2</h3>
<p>Battlefield 2 game management plugin that can dynamically<br />
move players into appropriate channels and groups to fit<br />
the in-game command structure. This is achieved by using<br />
data gathered from Mumble's positional audio system and does<br />
not require cooperation by the game server. </p>

<h3>idlemove</h3>
<p>Plugin for moving players that have been idle for<br />
a configurable amount of time into a idle channel. Optionally<br />
the players can be muted/deafened on move.</p>

<h3>seen</h3>
<p>Makes the server listen for a configurable keyword to ask for<br />
the last time a specific nick was seen on the server.</p>

<h3>[[mumo_source|source]]</h3>
<p>Source game management plugin that can dynamically move<br />
players into on-the-fly created channel structures representing<br />
in-game team setup. This is achieved by using data gathered from<br />
Mumble's positional audio system and does not require cooperation<br />
by the game server. Currently the following source engine based<br />
games are supported: Team Fortress 2, Day of Defeat: Source,<br />
Counter-Strike: Source, Half-Life 2: Deathmatch.</p>

<p>For more information on how to configure and use the source plugin see <a href="mumo_source">here</a>.</p>

<h3>test</h3>
<p>A debugging plugin that registers for all possible events and<br />
outputs every call with parameters into the debug log.</p>

<h2>3rd Party Modules</h2>
<h3>Image Injection Modules</h3>
<h4>URL to image</h4>
<p>[https://github.com/aciid/urltoimg-for-mumo urltoimg on GitHub]</p>

<p>If you send an image URL to the channel, the server fetches it and sends the image instead of the image link to the current channel.</p>

<h4>Chat Img</h4>
<p>[https://github.com/aselus-hub/chatimg-mumo chatimg on GitHub]</p>

<p>A more full featured implementation of the same functionality as Url to Image. Allows injection of photos into chat, re-sizing them if they are larger then the size accepted by the mumble protocol and allowing the server admin to set a max width/height for the image so that it is scaled through html or thumbnailing to never be larger then prescribed. Allows the conversion of images within regular chat messages w/o bang commands as an option. Finally the injection of any number of images present after the bang or within a message.</p>

<h2>Contributions</h2>
<p>If you have a module that you would like to see shipped with mumo or<br />
have any improvements or suggestions please contact us. Whether you<br />
prefer a pull request, visiting us in IRC in #mumble on Freenode or<br />
starting a thread in our forums at <a href="http://forums.mumble.info">http://forums.mumble.info</a> is up to you.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>To configure and run mumo take a look at the mumo.ini and the module<br />
specific configurations in modules-available folder. Enabling modules<br />
is done by linking the configuration in modules-available to the<br />
modules-enabled folder.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>mumo requires:<br />
 - python 2.7*<br />
 - python-zeroc-ice<br />
 - murmur &gt;=1.2.3*<br />
 - murmur &gt;=1.2.4 if you want to use a module which needs user interaction via text commands</p>

<ul>
	<li>Not tested with lower versions yet</li>
</ul>
<h1>Installing mumo</h1>
<p>The newest version of mumo is always available from our mumo repository at <a href="https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumo">https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumo</a> .</p>

<h2>Docker</h2>
<p>A docker image can be run with the command:<br />
    docker run <small>name mumo </small>net=container:&lt;id_of_mumble_server_container&gt; -d -v /path/to/mumo/folder:/data mumblevoip/mumo<br />
This is the base of the mumo service. It's allow addition of new module.</p>

<p>Warning:<br />
 - the service network-mode is mandatory to link mumble and mumo. Ice need to be in mumble-server localhost.<br />
 - the volume is to store all modules and configurations, you can add yours here. Subfolders will be automatically created ad first start.<br />
 - When you add new modules, you need the restart the container.</p>

<p>Here a docker-compose(v2.4) example:<br />
    mumble-mumo:<br />
        image: mumblevoip/mumo<br />
        container_name: mumble-mumo<br />
        restart: on-failure<br />
        volumes:<br />
            - /path/to/mumo/folder:/data<br />
        network_mode : "service:mumble-server"<br />
        depends_on:<br />
            - mumble-server</p>

<h2>Ubuntu 12.04</h2>
<p>''Note:'' This guide only shows the basic steps for trying out mumo. For a more permanent setup you'll want to run mumo with its own user and a startup script.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Make sure you are running a recent Murmur release (1.2.4 or later). Ice should be enabled and a writesecret must be set (see configuration file).</li>
	<li>Install dependencies sudo apt-get install python-zeroc-ice python-daemon git</li>
	<li>Clone repository cd / git clone <a href="https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumo.git">https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumo.git</a></li>
	<li>Adjust configuration cd mumo nano mumo.iniIn the editor set your server's Ice writesecret as the secret variable so mumo can control your server. secret = mysecretwritesecretClose and save by pressing Ctrl + X followed by Y and Enter.</li>
	<li>Configure the modules you want to use by editing their ini file in the modules-available folder</li>
	<li>Enable modules by linking their config file into the modules-enabled folder cd modules-enabled ln -s ../modules-available/moduleyouwanttouse.ini</li>
	<li>Run mumo ./mumo.py</li>
</ul>
<p>Mumo should now be working with your mumble server. If it doesn't work check the ''mumo.log'' file for more information.</p>
