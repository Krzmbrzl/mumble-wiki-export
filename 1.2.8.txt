A PulseAudio issue that could cause the Mumble client to crash on launch has been fixed.

Various source-level issues that made the Mumble build fail when built with Clang has been fixed.

The Windows installer, as well as all .EXE and .DLL files are now code-signed with an Authenticode signature that uses a SHA256 digest in addition to the previous SHA1-based signature.

The Windows build is now built using the buildenv/1.2.x/win32 build environment from mumble-releng.
