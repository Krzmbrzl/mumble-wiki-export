## About

Voice Comms Viewer is a site which allows you to create a Channel Viewer
for Mumble, Teamspeak & Ventrilo by filling in a simple form with the
details of your server. Once created you can place the small code block
on your site where visitors can see the state of you server and join
directly by clicking on the relevant links.

Voice Comms Viewer makes use of the standard [Channel Viewer
Protocol](Channel_Viewer_Protocol "wikilink") to provide support for
Mumble servers.
