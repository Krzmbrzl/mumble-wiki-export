= Introduction =

Mumble features various Audio Options and Features, this wiki page will describe them and tell you which settings are best for your setup.

== Interface ==

=== Echo Cancellation ===

If enabled, this will filter echo from the audio you send to others.<br>

You should enable it in the following cases: <br>
1. You use conventional loudspeakers and no headset:<br>
This Setup will usually create echo, so you will need echo cancellation.

2. Headset transmits echo, though it shouldn't: <br>
Some Headsets tend to transmit echo, the reasons for this include: bad cable and noise isolation or the microphone is to close to the loudspeakers of the headset.

Two options are implemented (you can choose one of them): <br>
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Option: !! Description: !! Usecase:
|-
| 1. Mixed echo cancellation || This is the basic Option: It will process all loudspeaker outputs bundled together. <br>This is less accurate than the Multichannel option, but will also use less CPU. || Sufficient for setups with loudspeakers near to the microphone.

|-
| 2. Multichannel echo cancellation || Extended option: It will process all audio channels seperately, this is more accurate, but will result in higher CPU usage. || For setups with (multiple) loudspeakers farther away from the microphone.
|}

In case of doubt: <br>
1. Try ''Mixed echo cancellation'' first. <br>
2. If ''Mixed echo cancellation'' does not filter the echo correctly, try ''Multichannel echo cancellation''. <br>


'''Alternatives:'''<br>
You can also use external echo filters.

{{Notice
|message=In this case you should deactivate the echo filters in Mumble (to avoid interference).

Examples for external echo filters: <br>
* Pulseaudio Module: [https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/User/Modules/#index45h3 Documentation (options only)]
* Pulseeffects: [https://github.com/wwmm/pulseeffects pulseeffects on Github]

== Audio Processing ==

=== RNNoise ===

RNNoise is a noise suppression library.<br>
It is intended to filter background noises from the audio that is sent to other users.<br>
RNNoise uses a deep learning algorithm so it should work better than most regular filters.
