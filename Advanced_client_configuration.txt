NOTE: Since Mumble version 1.3 there is no advanced mode anymore. You will see all settings in the settings dialog.

Mumble shows the most important client options only in settings dialog. To show all options, click on "Configure" -> "Settings" and check "Advanced" in the bottom left corner.

After checking advanced, the settings dialog will show a lot of additional settings, and new settings categories.
